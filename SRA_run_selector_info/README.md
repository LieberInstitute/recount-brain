Here Ashkaun will add all the SRA Run Selector tables for each project in the [projects_list.txt](../projects_list.txt) table with at least 70 percent brain samples and 4 total samples (67 projects total). The tables will be named with the project ids. As an example, I included the data for https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP045638.
