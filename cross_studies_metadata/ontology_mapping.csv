It is between BA10 and BA45. BA46 is known as middle frontal area 46. In the human it occupies approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. Brodmann area 46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), although the borders of area 46 are based on cytoarchitecture rather than function. The DLPFC also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex. Cytoarchitecturally, BA46 is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, rostroventrally by the frontopolar area 10 and caudally by the triangular area 45 (Brodmann-1909). There is some discrepancy between the extent of BA8 (Brodmann-1905) and the same area as described by Walker (1940)","false",NA,NA,"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0013529","UBERON","Substantia nigra"

With respect to neurotransmitter systems, there is evidence that dopamine plays a particularly important role in DL-PFC.[2]DL-PFC is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, and to a variety of brain areas, which include the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex, including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas","false",NA,NA,"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002616|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0010314","UBERON","Prefrontal cortex"
