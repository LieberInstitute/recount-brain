"1946",734,"human","Cerebral organoids Ã¢â¬â three-dimensional cultures of human cerebral tissue derived from pluripotent stem cells Ã¢â¬â have emerged as models of human cortical development. However, the extent to which in vitro organoid systems recapitulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation programs observed in vivo remains unclear. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect and compare cell composition and progenitor-to-neuron lineage relationships in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. Covariation network analysis using the fetal neocortex data reveals known and novel interactions among genes central to neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In the organoid, we detect diverse progenitors and differentiated cell types of neuronal and mesenchymal lineages, and identify cells that derived from regions resembling the fetal neocortex. We find that these organoid cortical cells use gene expression programs remarkably similar to those of the fetal tissue in order to organize into cerebral cortex-like regions. Our comparison of in vivo and in vitro cortical single cell transcriptomes illuminates the genetic features underlying human cortical development that can be studied in organoid cultures. Overall design: 734 single-cell transcriptomes from human fetal neocortex or human cerebral organoids from multiple time points were analyzed in this study. All single cell samples were processed on the microfluidic Fluidigm C1 platform and contain 92 external RNA spike-ins.

Cerebral organoid data were also generated from microdissected cortical-like regions from H9 embryonic stem cell derived organoids at 53 days (region 1, 48 cells; region 2, 48 cells) or from iPSC 409B2 organoids at 58 days (region 3, 43 cells; region 4, 36 cells).","SRP066834",FALSE,"https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP066834",150,480,0,225,20.4359673024523,65.3950953678474,0,30.6539509536785,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Also, we observe that protocols using ribosomal RNA depletion can both salvage degraded RNA samples and also be readily compared to polyA-enriched fractions.

"187",345,"human","The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potential markers and targets for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, respectively. We determined myocardial and circulating miRNA abundance and its changes in patients with stable and end-stage heart failure before and at different time points after mechanical unloading by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) by small-RNA-sequencing. MiRNA changes in failing heart tissues partially resembled that of fetal myocardium. Consistent with prototypical miRNAÃ¢â¬âtarget-mRNA interactions, target mRNA levels were negatively correlated to changes in abundance for highly expressed miRNAs in heart failure and fetal hearts. The circulating small RNA profile was dominated by miRNAs, and fragments of tRNAs and small cytoplasmic RNAs. Heart- and muscle-specific circulating miRNAs (myomirs) increased up to 140-fold in advanced heart failure, which coincided with a similar increase in cardiac troponin I protein, the established marker for heart injury. These extracellular changes nearly completely reversed 3 months following initiation of LVAD support. In stable heart failure, circulating miRNAs showed less than 5-fold differences compared to normal, and myomir and cardiac troponin I levels were only captured near the detection limit. These findings provide the underpinning for miRNA-based therapies and emphasize the usefulness of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for heart injury performing similar to established diagnostic protein biomarkers.

Using mRNA sequencing, we analyzed the transcriptomes of fetal human and embryonic mouse VZ, SVZ and cortical plate (CP). We describe sets of genes that are up- or down-regulated in each germinal zone. These data suggest that cell adhesion and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions promote the proliferation and self-renewal of neural progenitors in the developing human neocortex. Notably, relevant ECM-associated genes include distinct sets of collagens, laminins, proteoglycans and integrins, along with specific sets of growth factors and morphogens. Our data establish a basis for identifying novel cell-type markers and open up avenues to unravel the molecular basis of neocortex expansion during evolution.

The study will then evaluate the effect on this identified profile of ASO treatment targeting the sense strand RNA transcript of the C9orf72 gene. Methods: Expression profiling was performed on RNAs from fibroblasts of four C9orf72 patients, four control individuals and four sporadic ALS patients using Multiplex Analysis of PolyA-linked Sequences method. Results: Hierarchical clustering of expression values for all genes showed that the four C9orf72 patient lines had an expression profile distinct from control and sporadic ALS lines. Statistical comparison of expression values between the four C9orf72 lines and the four control lines revealed that 122 genes were upregulated (defined by a False Discovery Rate FDR<0.05) and 34 genes were downregulated (defined by a False Discovery Rate FDR <0.05) in C9orf72 patient fibroblasts. Conclusions: A genome wide RNA signature can be defined in fibroblasts with C9orf72 expansion.

However, large-scale analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals. Our transcriptome data provide a valuable resource for functional and evolutionary analyses of mammalian genomes. Overall design: To study mammalian transcriptome evolution at high resolution, we generated RNA-Seq data (~3.2 billion Illumina Genome Analyser IIx reads of 76 base pairs) for the polyadenylated RNA fraction of brain (cerebral cortex or whole brain without cerebellum), cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver and testis (usually from one male and one female per somatic tissue and two males for testis) from nine mammalian species: placental mammals (great apes, including humans; rhesus macaque; mouse), marsupials (gray short-tailed opossum) and monotremes (platypus).

We developed a sequencing method to quantitatively map the 3' ends of the transcriptome of diverse human tissues and isogenic transformation systems. We found that cell type-specific gene expression is accomplished by two complementary programs. Tissue-restricted genes tend to have single 3'UTRs whereas a majority of ubiquitously transcribed genes generate multiple 3'UTRs. During transformation and differentiation, single-UTR genes change their mRNA abundance levels while multi-UTR genes mostly change 3'UTR isoform ratios to achieve tissue-specificity.

Further, alternative splicing of human NAGNAGs was associated with an order of magnitude increase in the frequency of exon length changes at orthologous mouse/rat exon boundaries, suggesting that NAGNAGs accelerate exon evolution.

We identify ~11,000 primate- specific lncRNA families, which show evidence for selective constraint during recent evolution, and ~2,400 highly conserved lncRNAs (including ~400 genes that likely originated more than 300 million years ago). We find that lncRNAs, in particular ancient ones, are generally actively regulated and may predominantly function in embryonic development. lncRNA X-inactivation patterns reveal an extremely female-biased monotreme-specific lncRNA, which may partially compensate X-dosage in this lineage. Most lncRNAs evolve rapidly in terms of sequence and expression levels, but global patterns like tissue specificities are often conserved. We compared expression patterns of homologous lncRNA and protein-coding families across tetrapods to reconstruct an evolutionarily conserved co-expression network.

Results:Transcript analysis of U87-MG xenografts overexpressing control (V0), KPC1 or p50 vector mapped  to the human genome  revealed: Ã¢â¬Â¢ A strong similarity between overexpression of p50 and KPC1 (correlation of 0.51, p-value<10-300 ) Ã¢â¬Â¢ A specific signature of NF-kB targets [21 of the consistently changed genes are known to be regulated by NF-kB (p-value<3.4Ãâ10-9 )] Ã¢â¬Â¢ A significant (p-value<1.4Ãâ10-18) increase in the expression of 40 tumor suppressor genes, with no significant change in other classes. Ã¢â¬Â¢ A significant down regulation of a cluster of genes including LIN28B, IL-6, HMAGA2 and VEGFA. This finding links well to an established regulatory axis involving LIN28B, Let-7 microRNA, and IL-6 in inflammation and cell transformation that is regulated by NF-kB. Overall design: Exponentially growing U87-MG cells were stably transfected with an empty vector (V0) or vectors coding for Myc-KPC1 or Flag-p50.

"857",11,"human","Background: The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is activated by xenobiotic chemicals that function as AHR ligands.  The response to xenobiotic AHR ligands is toxicity and the induction of drug metabolizing enzymes. The impact of AHR knockdown on gene expression and pathways in human breast cancer cells in absence of xenobiotic AHR ligands has not been investigated on a genome-wide scale. Methods: MCF-7 cells were used as a model of human breast cancer.  The AHR was silenced with short interfering RNA against AHR (siAHR).  RNA-sequencing coupled with Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to determine the impact of AHR knockdown on gene expression and pathways in the absence of xenobiotic AHR ligands.  Western blot analysis and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was used to investigate the impact of AHR knockdown on TNF induction of MNSOD expression. Results: We found that the AHR is transcriptionally active in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in the absence of xenobiotic AHR ligands.  In total, the expression of 634 genes was significantly changed in AHR knockdown cells compared to controls at a false discovery rate of < 10%. The analysis confirmed that drug metabolizing enzymes were AHR targets; however, we found that AHR also promoted the expression of genes that were not directly related to the metabolism of xenobiotics, such as those involved in lipid and eicosanoid synthesis.  Gene pathway analysis of the AHR regulated gene dataset predicted TNF activity to be reduced in AHR knockdown cells.  Our finding that AHR knockdown inhibited TNF-stimulated increases in MNSOD expression confirmed this IPA prediction. Conclusions: This is the first gene expression profiling study of AHR knockdown breast cancer cells.  Several known and novel AHR targets were identified.  The results suggest that endogenous AHR regulation impacts eicosanoid synthesis by regulating gene expression.  The IPA prediction of reduced TNF activity in AHR knockdown cells was confirmed by showing that TNF-induced increases in MNSOD expression was inhibited in AHR knockdown cells.   The requirement of AHR for MNSOD activation is novel and provides a new link by which AHR may impact reactive oxidative species (ROS) signaling. Overall design: Expression profiles by mRNA sequencing were generated for human MCF-7 cells transfected with cRNAi (6 replicates) or AHR-siRNA (5 replicates) for 36hr.

Here, we present a method, allele-specific alternative mRNA processing (ASARP), to identify genetically influenced mRNA processing events using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. The method examines RNA-Seq data at both single nucleotide and whole-gene/isoform levels to identify allele-specific expression (ASE) and existence of allele-specific regulation of mRNA processing. We applied the methods to data obtained from the human glioblastoma cell line U87MG and primary breast cancer tissues and found that 26Ã¢â¬â45% of all genes with sufficient read coverage demonstrated ASE, with significant overlap between the two cell types. Our methods predicted potential mechanisms underlying ASE due to regulations affecting either whole-gene-level expression or alternative mRNA processing, including alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation and alternative transcriptional initiation. Allele-specific alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation may explain ASE in hundreds of genes in each cell type. Reporter studies following these predictions identified the causal single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for several allele-specific alternative splicing events. Finally, many genes identified in our study were also reported as disease/phenotype-associated genes in genome-wide association studies. Future applications of our approach may provide ample insights for a better understanding of the genetic basis of gene regulation underlying phenotypic diversity and disease mechanisms.

"341",4,"human","RNA editing enhances the diversity of gene products at the post-transcriptional level. Approaches for genome-wide identification of RNA editing face two main challenges: separating true editing sites from false discoveries and accurate estimation of editing levels. We developed an approach to analyze transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-Seq) for global identification of RNA editing in cells for which whole-genome sequencing data are available. We applied the method to analyze RNA-Seq data of a human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG. Around 10,000 DNA-RNA differences were identified, the majority being putative A-to-I editing sites. These predicted A-to-I events were associated with a low false discovery rate (~5%). Moreover, the estimated editing levels from RNA-Seq correlated well with those based on traditional clonal sequencing. Our results further facilitated unbiased characterization of the sequence and evolutionary features flanking predicted A-to-I editing sites and discovery of a conserved RNA structural motif that may be functionally relevant to editing. Genes with predicted A-to-I editing were significantly enriched with those known to be involved in cancer, supporting the potential importance of cancer-specific RNA editing. A similar profile of DNA-RNA differences as in U87MG was predicted for another RNA-Seq data set obtained from primary breast cancer samples. Remarkably, significant overlap exists between the putative editing sites of the two transcriptomes despite their difference in cell type, cancer type and genomic backgrounds. Our approach enabled de novo identification of the RNA editome, which sets the stage for further mechanistic studies of this important step of post-transcriptional regulation.

"1078",4,"human","Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), a multifunctional protein expressed by the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in latently-infected cells, is required for stable maintenance of the viral episome. This is mediated by two interactions: LANA binds to specific sequences (LBS1 and 2) on viral DNA, and also engages host histones, tethering the viral genome to host chromosomes in mitosis. LANA has also been suggested to affect host gene expression, but both the mechanism(s) and role of this dysregulation in KSHV biology remain unclear. Here we have examined LANA interactions with host chromatin on a genome-wide scale using ChIP-seq, and show that LANA predominantly targets human genes near their transcriptional start sites (TSSs). These host LANA-binding sites are generally found within transcriptionally active promoters and display striking overrepresentation of a consensus DNA sequence virtually identical to the LBS1 motif in KSHV DNA. Comparison of the ChIP-seq profile with whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) data reveals that few of the genes that are differentially regulated in latent infection are occupied by LANA at their promoters. This suggests that direct LANA binding to promoters is not the prime determinant of altered host transcription in KSHV-infected cells. Most surprisingly, the association of LANA to both host and viral DNA is strongly disrupted during the lytic cycle of KSHV. This disruption can be prevented by the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis, suggesting the existence of novel and potent regulatory mechanisms linked to either viral DNA replication or late gene expression.

Two independent mechanisms such as kinase and phosphatase signaling cascades leading hyperphosphorylation of tau protein were regulated by the expression of APP-sw.

In cultured non-cancerous epithelial cells, KLF5 converts from pro-proliferative to anti-proliferative activity upon TGFÃÅ¸-induced acetylation, which sequentially alters the KLF5 transcriptional complex and the expression of genes such as p15 and MYC. In nude mice, KLF5 also suppressed tumor growth in an acetylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, deacetylation switched KLF5 to tumor-promoting activity, and blocking TGFÃÅ¸ signaling attenuated the tumor suppressor activity of KLF5.
