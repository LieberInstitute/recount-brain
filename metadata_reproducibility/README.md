# Reproducibility Document

Using the “predicted” formula, listed all SRA studies with \>70% brain tissue samples.

Using the SRA Run Selector, downloaded metadata as text file for each SRA study listed.

Examined metadata for common annotated variables of interest.

Obtained all corresponding publications and supplementary information/tables/figures.

Searched full papers and detailed supplementary information for useful sample attributes not explicitly labeled or included in the study metadata. 

Opened metadata for each SRA study in Excel and individually saved each Excel sheet as its associated SRA study ID.

Created a uniform set of variables that would be annotated for the database, and added this set of variables as new column headings to each Excel sheet. 

If downloaded metadata already included variable data for one or more of our uniform set of variables, then we simply aligned variable data to match wording, spelling, and capitalization with our uniform set of variables (see Figure 1 for a table of variables used and a list of sample attributes found in the database).

If sample attribute information (that was not labeled in the original SRA study metadata) was obtained from the study’s corresponding publication or supplementary material, then sample data was manually added to the Excel sheet for that SRA study.

Detailed exact location that sample attribute was specifically stated in publication (referencing article, page, section, sentence, table, and figure). 

See specific information and reproducible steps taken for inputting novel sample data for each individual study under its SRA Study ID heading.
